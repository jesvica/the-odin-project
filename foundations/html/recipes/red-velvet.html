    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons red food coloring</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cocoa</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Icing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
    
        <li>Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>

        <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>

        <li>Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
