                <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="recipe-headings">Icing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h3 class="recipe-headings">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
                <li>Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric   mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine   red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
                <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour, alternating   with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about    30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until     thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer  until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading     consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
